## Chapter summary by individual page:

Please process this page from a chapter on [], which part of a textbook on []. Your task is to summarize this content in a manner comprehensible and digestible to undergraduate students. Your content should comprise of the following:

- A header that briefly encapsulates the page
- A 500-600 word summary of the page. This should not exceed 3 paragraphs.
- 2-3 key concepts that were provided in the page, with a brief exposition of each.

Please ensure that your summary is formal, direct, informative and engaging. Your output should be structured as follows:

***
Header:
Summary: (500-600 words)
Key Concepts: (2-3)
References: (1-2)
***

## Follow up on Chat History to integrate summaries into chapter  (unselect Directory)

You are an excellent and proficient educator with a extensive background in Psychology. You have been tasked to write a textbook based on the attached summaries. Each summary you read represents the content of an individual page. Your task is to integrate these summaries into a cohesive, informative and self-contained module for presentation in Markdown. Please review the page summaries carefully, synthesizing across common ideas as needed. Because many pages identify similar key concepts, integrate across them when you're constructing your chapter. I permit you to have full freedom in constructing the chapter, using the knowledge contained in the summaries above.  Ensure your chapter is at least 6000 words in total, and never less than 5000 words. 

I have provided a general guideline for you to follow when constructing the chapter:

1. Chapter title (main header)
2. Chapter summary (~300 words)
3. Key concepts to be introduced (8-10, each with a ~50 word elaboration)
4. Components (4-5) - these will include
	- Component subheading
        - Textbook content, presented in an engaging way that relates to the other sub-components and the chapter overall (~1000 words each)
        - Component conclusion (wrap up the content neatly, and prepare the reader for the upcoming component)
5. Conclusion (~400 words)
6. References
7. 4-5 image prompts for DALL-E 3 inside square brackets. These should be simple and relevant for the chapter. 
8. The overall output should never be less than 5000 words.
9. Double-check your response for rendundancies before output. 
10. Given the short word count (for a chapter), be as informatively rich as possible in the chapter. Be concise, objective and logical - do not utilize any superflous or pedantic terms.

Given your limits, it is understandable that you will not be able to produce an entire chapter's worth of content from all the summaries provided. This is why you can place markers inside square brackets. You can state something to the effect of "[EXPAND ON TOPIC]", where the "TOPIC" is inferred from your output. Place these markers besides content that would be worth elaborating on in a later re-edit. Ensure to clearly place these throughout your response as needed, and number them. For example, "[1. EXPAND ON TOPIC]", "[2. EXPAND ON TOPIC]", and so on.

[Prompt for generating lectures from slides]

**Prompt for GPT:**

---

**Task Overview:**

You will be processing a PDF file containing a lecture on [insert specific topic area, e.g., "Cognitive Development in Adolescence"]. Your goal is to create a [insert intended duration, e.g., "30-minute"] lecture transcript that complements the PDF content.

**Instructions:**

1. **PDF Processing:**
   - Carefully analyze each slide in the provided PDF. Pay attention to the key talking points and any additional information presented.

2. **Transcript Creation:**
   - Based on your analysis, generate a transcript that is structured around the individual slides.
   - Each section of the transcript should correspond to a slide from the PDF, and you should include timestamps indicating where each segment falls within the overall lecture duration.

3. **Audience Consideration:**
   - The intended audience is undergraduate psychology students, some of whom may have limited English proficiency. Ensure that your language is clear and accessible.
   - Avoid overly complex terms and keep your language formal yet engaging, using minimal adjectives and without superfluous terminology.

4. **Formatting Requirements:**
   - Divide the transcript into clearly defined sections, each with a subheader that identifies the slide topic.
   - Maintain a neat structure with coherent paragraphs for easy readability.

**Output Example Format:**

- **[Timestamp: HH:MM] Slide Title 1**
  
  [Content related to slide 1...]
  
- **[Timestamp: HH:MM] Slide Title 2**
  
  [Content related to slide 2...]
  
- **[Timestamp: HH:MM] Slide Title 3**
  
  [Content related to slide 3...]

**Final Note:**
Please ensure your transcript not only reflects the information from the slides but also conveys it in a manner that is engaging and easy to understand for the target audience.
